# Hiragana
 Flask App to learn Hiraguana and Katakana.
 Please note I use Gif from Wikipedia which is under GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) while GitHub only allow GNU GPL.

## Backfround
I purchase flash cards to recognise the caracter (for the JPL5  exam) but I missed the inverse operation (writing the caracters).
I use the Gif from Wikipedia because the strokes have a specific order in japanese.

 ## How to use
 Personally, I just run the code from an editor.
